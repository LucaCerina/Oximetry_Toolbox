Description: # OBM Toolbox
        
        Python package for extracting biomarkers from oximetry signal, the SpO2.
        Based on the paper Levy Jeremy, √Ålvarez Daniel, Rosenberg Aviv A., del Campo Felix and Behar Joachim A. "Oximetry digital biomarkers for assessing respiratory function during sleep: standards of measurement, physiological interpretation, and clinical use". 
        Under review in Nature Digital Medicine.
        
        ## Description
        
        5 types of biomarkers are extracted:
        
        General Statistics: time-based statistics describing the oxygen saturation time series data distribution.
        
        Complexity: quantify the presence of long-range correlations in non-stationary time series.
        
        Periodicity: quantify consecutive events creating some periodicity in the oxygen saturation time series.
        
        Desaturations: time-based measures that are descriptive statistics of the desaturation patterns happening throughout the time series.
        
        Hypoxic burden: time-based measures quantifying the overall degree of hypoxemia imposed to the heart and other organs during the recording period.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Available on pip, with the command: 
        python -m pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ obmtoolbox
        
        ## Requirements
        
        numpy==1.18.2
        
        scikit-learn==0.22.2
        
        scipy==1.4.1
        
        lempel-ziv-complexity==0.2.2
        
        All the requirements are installed when the toolbox is installed, no need for additional commands.
