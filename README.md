# OBM Toolbox

Oximetry digital biomarkers for the analysis of continuous oximetry (SpO2) recordings.

Based on the paper Levy Jeremy, √Ålvarez Daniel, Rosenberg Aviv A., del Campo Felix and Behar Joachim A. "Oximetry digital biomarkers for assessing respiratory function during sleep: standards of measurement, physiological interpretation, and clinical use". 
Under review in Nature Digital Medicine.

## Description

5 types of biomarkers are extracted:

General Statistics: time-based statistics describing the oxygen saturation time series data distribution.

Complexity: quantify the presence of long-range correlations in non-stationary time series.

Periodicity: quantify consecutive events creating some periodicity in the oxygen saturation time series.

Desaturations: time-based measures that are descriptive statistics of the desaturation patterns happening throughout the time series.

Hypoxic burden: time-based measures quantifying the overall degree of hypoxemia imposed to the heart and other organs during the recording period.
